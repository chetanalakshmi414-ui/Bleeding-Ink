	<h1 style="background-color:Pink";> EDUCATION IS THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON THAT CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THE WORLD. THERE IS ALWAYS AN ACCURATE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND AN EFFICIENT AND SERENE EDUCATION. Education isn't always about books, papers and stationary, it also lies in memories you make throughout the course. Things can be learnt in different ways; through practicals, activities, group discussions and seminars. </h1>

	   	</tr>
	   	<tr> 
	   		<td>  2)THE BLURTING METHOD: It is another study method, which illustrates that- when a person finishes reading, he immediately puts down all the information he remembers on a paper and underlines the points he has missed in writing. </td>
	   	</tr>
	   	<tr> 
            <td>3)THE FENYMAN TECHNIQUE: Another common technique practised by most of the students for proper conceptual understanding and clarity. In this case, a person learns a concept and explains it to the other person or a non-living entity. THE MORE YOU EXPLAIN THINGS TO SOMEONE IS THE MORE UNDERSTANDING YOU ACQUIRE FROM THE TOPIC.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
        	<td>4)THE POMODORO TECHNIQUE:This kind of practise is very much efficient for procrastinators. This specific thing, involves 25 minutes of focused studying and 5 minutes of break. At certain times, this technique may not work for the ones who are always distracted by some or the other thing. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    <h1> THEORY OF MUGGING UP CONCEPTS (ROTE REPETITION) </h1> 
    <hr>
    <p> ROTE REPETITION CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS A WAY OF LEARNING BUT THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF IT.YOU JUST MUG UP THINGS WITHOUT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING THEM, IT CAN ACTUALLY LEAD YOU TO DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES- like forgetting the concept in a short span of time; mixing up one concept with another which could make no sense and sound confusing.
    Rote repetion can sound ordinary or really common to few people out there- you may mug up the things but it would only be stored in your short-term memory (which again correlates with cognitive development); and can have all the possible adverse consequences in future. </p>

                <h1> 1)STAY HYDRATED AND MEDITATE (meditation is optional since it depends upon your anxiety levels before an exam) </h1> <br>
