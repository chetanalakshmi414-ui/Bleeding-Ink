        <h1 style="background-color:Pink";> INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY:</h1>
            <p>
              <h3> A branch of psychology which deals with the mental health of an individual,it was proposed by 
Lightner Witmer in the year 1896 at a psychological clinic.Mental health issues such as 
anxiety,depression,isolation from people, these are few overlapping and non-impervious issues faced by 
half of ssssthe youth in this 21st century. There are several factors for this sort of 
human behaviour.</h3>
<hr>
<h2 style = "background-color: Gray;"> FACTORS AFFECTING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF A PERSON:</h2>
<h1 style="background-color:Pink">1) PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES:</h1>
<p> There may be several things that an individual has to deal with irrespective of their age factor and gender. Just like any other thing, even the human brain has its own limit of tolerance towards circumstances. So, before you start criticizing or passing judgements about a person's behaviour or actions, give a thought about the things he is going through and try to analyze them as per their point of view.</p>. <h3> POINT TO BE NOTED: EVEN A SMALL "HOW ARE YOU?, ARE YOU OKAY?" STATEMENT COULD HELP ENHANCING THEIR MOOD AND COME OUT FROM THE TRAUMA. </h3>
<hr>
<h1 style="background-color:Pink"> 2)GENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND FAMILY ENVIRONMENT:</h1>
<h3> At certain times, the first factor may seem illogical or just sound dumb but generational trauma a person carries on his shoulders is just a big thing to worry about- when a person feels nervous or anxious for absolute no reason, it is a literal warning sign that the specific individual should seek for help/therapy. Getting anxious for no reason, flinching at every single taunt from anyone-these sort of things are nothing silly.  </h3>
<hr>
<h1 style="background-color:Pink"> 3)PERSON'S SURROUNDINGS </h1>
<h3> It is clearly to be understood that a person's surroundings can shape a person's mindset and his/her behaviour as well. Around the people he grew up around and the things he's been taught. </h3>
<hr>
<h1 style="background-color:Pink"> 4)HIS/HER CURRENT LIFESTYLE</h1>
<h3> There is something called comfort and security, we always have to make sure that the person you are talking to is actually comfortable and not uneasy. </h3>  
<h1 style="background-color:Pink">5) HIGH ACADEMIC/PEER PRESSURE:</h1>
<h3> At some or the other point of time in life, we often tend to compare our grades with other students and we feel that we cannot cope up with our peers at instances but a butterfly doesn't see its own wings; every student is special and unique and that individual doesn't deserve comparison or criticism from the society </h3>
<h1 style="background-color:Pink">6)SLEEP DISORDER </h1>
<h3> Not acquiring sufficient amount of sleep can have a huge adverse consequence on your mental health and can lead you to disorders like anxiety, migraine and depression which can make the things even more worse so it is high time to fix your sleep scheduleand atleast acquire 7-8 hours of sleep everyday which is really essential for your physical and mental well being. 
 <h1> OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF SLEEP </h1>
 <h3> 1)MIGRAINE: IT CAN OCCUR IRRESPECTIVE OF THE GENETICS AS WELL IF AN INDIVIDUAL'S SLEEP SCHEDULE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH </h3>
 <hr> 
 <h3> 2)WRINKLES AND FACE TURNING PALE </h3>
 <hr> 
 <h3> 3)DEPRESSION: SOMETIMES LATE NIGHTS PUT YOU INTO DEEP AND NEGATIVE THOUGHTS WHICH MAKE YOU OVERTHINK ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN LEADS YOU TO THE MOST OVERRATED STAGE-DEPRESSION.</h3>

 	<h1> WHAT EXACTLY IS A PHOBIA? </h1>
 	<h3> A phobia is an intense and irrational fear caused by an object, which affects the person's behaviour and makes that specific individual anxious about a specific thing. Many people consider phobia as some phenomenon of exaggeration but in reality it can cause many possible mood swings and affect a person's mental health if that person gets no help or attention.A phobia can be born due to a past horrible experience as well. Example: Fear of water:Hydrophobia </h3>
 	<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue";> DIFFERENT TYPES OF PHOBIAS AND THEIR SPECIFIC OUTCOME </h1>
 	<h3> 1)HYDROPHOBIA</h3>
 	<h3> 2)CLAUSTRAPHOBIA </h3>
 	<h3> 3)ARACHNOPHOBIA </h3>
 	<h3> 4)ACRAPHOBIA </h3>
 	<h3> 5)SOCIAL PHOBIA </h3> 
 	<hr> 
 	<h1 style="background-color:Pink"> We have only highlighted the above 5 phobias because these are the most familiar ones we come across in our daily life. Moreover, these are often ignored by people. </h1>
 	<h3> HYDROPHOBIA: As the name itself suggests "hydro":meaning=water- it is the fear of water where an individual is extremely scared of water and feels uneasy to jump into swimming pools/ normally fea </h3>
 	<hr> 
 	<h3> CLAUSTRAPHOBIA: Fear of closed spaces- it can seem to be scary and anguish especially when you enter into some cave and a person being claustrophobic should be really mindful about things </h3> 
 	<hr>
 	<h3> ARACHNOPHOBIA: Fear of animals (insects more specifically)</h3>
 	<hr> 
 	<h2> ACRAPHOBIA: Fear of heights </h2>
 	<hr> 
 	<h3> SOCIAL PHOBIA: It is the most common phobia we find in few people, in this aspect, the person suffers from the fear of being judged or criticized which sometimes leads to extreme clumsiness and awkwardness. The person may avoid social situations which give him/her anxiety- like meeting new people,  awkward conversations and public speaking as well. </h3>
 	<hr>
 	<h1> In conclusion, phobias are not meant to be ignored. It isn't right to make fun of someone suffering from any kind of phobia- the person just requires reassurance and a bit of confidence which can help them to overcome a specific phobia. Few messages like:
 		<h3> YOU ARE DOING ENOUGH! </h3>
 		<h3> I AM PROUD OF YOU! </h3>
 		<h3> IT IS COMPLETELY FINE TO MAKE MISTAKES, EVERYONE DOES! </h3>
 		<hr> 
 		<h2> The above three statements can boost that individual's confidence and help him/her to overcome a particular phobia </h2>

 		<h1 style="background-color:Yellow">  A BRIEF ABOUT OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER </h1> 
 		<h3>Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person gets repeated, unwanted thoughts or fears (called obsessions) and feels pushed to do certain actions or rituals (called compulsions) to reduce the anxiety or discomfort those thoughts create.
        These thoughts and actions feel hard to control, take up time, and can get in the way of daily life — even though the person usually knows the behaviour doesn’t logically make sense. In cases, the person suffering from this disorder can want everything to be in a precise position,tidy,neat and everything clean. </h3> 
        <hr> 
        <h1> IMPACT: </h1>
        <h3> Though ocd doesn't fully affect the mental health of a person- it usually has few minor negative consequences-
        </h3>
        <h3> 1)LACK OF FOCUS/CONCENTRATION </h3>
        <h3> 2)CONSTANT RESTLESSNESS </h3> 
        <h3> 3)ANXIETY </h3>
        <hr> 
        <h1> PREVENTION </h1> 
        <h3> There is no definite way to completely prevent Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD), because it is influenced by genetics, brain chemistry and life experiences as well. HERE ARE CERTAIN TIPS WHICH COULD ATLEAST REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS SYNDROME: </h3>
        <h3> 1)MANAGE STRESS </h3> 
        <h3> 2)NORMALIZE NOT HAVING THINGS TO BE PRECISED- RECITE AFFIRMATIONS </h3> 
        <h3> 3)WORK UPON YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH </h3>
