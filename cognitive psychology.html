<h3> His theory basically emphasizes how a child's cognitive skills can be developed through interactions and various activities, culture and language </h3>
<h2> Cognitive Development is as important as that of physical and mental development. A very crucial thing can be even more enhanced through communication and public speaking skills.</h2> 
	<h1 style="background-color:Yellow";> THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SPEAKING IS EXCEPTIONALLY ENORMOUS AND MASTERING THIS SKILL REQUIRES SELF-CONFIDENCE, FEARLESSNESS AND GUTS.

<h1 style= "background-color:Pink"> IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SPEAKING~</h1>
<h3> The importance of public speaking is enormous. Many people lack this skill and they tend to become nervous and anxious while giving a presentation in front of a huge crowd. Although this fear is familiar, we must overcome it.
Few ways to overcome this fear:<br>
1)Firstly, face your fear and practice things that make you feel anxious. <br>
2)Practice your speech in front of a mirror because the mirror doesn’t judge you. <br> 
3)Stop being afraid of people’s opinions:<br>
It is easy to sit in the crowd, give a round of applause, and judge the speaker but it is difficult to take over the stage and give a presentation So just give your best and leave the rest. Practice mindfulness and gratitude:
The most powerful thing in this universe is prayer; it calms you and enhances your thoughts. It improves your mental health and gives you a positive vibe, which helps you to deliver your speech wonderfully.
THE MORE YOU SPEAK IS THE MORE YOU OVERCOME THE FEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING AND WOULD BE ABLE TO FACE THE WORLD WITH BOLDNESS, BRAVERY AND GUTS. YOU CAN START AWAY YOUR JOURNEY OF PUBLIC SPEAKING BY CONTACTING @bleedingink.gmail.com.  </h3>
