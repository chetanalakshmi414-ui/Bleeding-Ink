    <td> <h4> TO BE PERFORMED IN A ROOM FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT SILENCE: QUIET ENVIRONMENT,THE ACTUAL INTERACTION WITH ENTITIES HAPPENS IN THE ASTRAL OR SPIRITUAL DIMENSIONS, WHICH ARE PLANES OF EXISTENCE ACCESSED THROUGH AN ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, NOT A PHYSICAL LOCATION YOU CAN TRAVEL TO IN THE MATERIAL WORLD.
PREPARATION: PRACTITIONERS EMPHASIZE CREATING A SUITABLE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING A NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE MINDSET, CLEAR INTENTIONS, AND SOMETIMES CALLING ON SPIRIT GUIDES OR HIGHER POWERS FOR PROTECTION BEFORE ATTEMPTING COMMUNICATION , find a quiet, comfortable place and relax deeply through meditation, focusing on your breathing to enter a trance-like state. Once relaxed, use techniques like visualizing an object, feeling vibrations, or using an "exit method" like the rope technique to separate your consciousness from your physical body. It's helpful to be patient, avoid distractions, and maintain a clear mind. There are certian things to take care of while performing this sort of activity, the first one is to remove the fear of death.
Secondary thing is to persuade your inner subconscious with positive thoughts.
The third one lies in your personal beliefs about astral projection and the way you observe things throughout the time.The person lies down, closes their eyes, and takes slow, steady breaths to calm the body and mind. Once relaxed, meditation or visualization techniques are used to increase focus and awareness. The individual may imagine themselves floating, climbing an invisible rope, or slowly rising above their body. During this phase, maintaining a balance between wakefulness and sleep is essential — the body remains still while the mind stays alert. If successful, a sense of lightness or vibration may occur, indicating that the astral body is detaching. With practice, the individual can then consciously explore the astral realm before gently returning to the physical body through intention or visualization. </p> </h4>

<h1> MYTHS,SUPERSTITIONS AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS </h1>
<h2> Many people assume things that because of this phenomenon leading to death or things becoming even more miserable but fortunately science and few religious scriptures of hinduism, christianity and other egyptian greek scriptures expose the reality of this phenomenon. </h2>
<h1 style="background-color: Pink"> 1)HINDUISM(VEDAS,PURANAS) 
<h3> These texts describe astral projection as some sort of yogic practice pursued during the last ashrama (sanyasi) of human life: As they say, science is born out of creation (the five elements of nature) Yoga Nidra is one of the popular practice of those who completely surrender to god during the sanyasi ashram.This text mentions the Liṅga Śarīra, a concept related to the subtle body that is a key element in the idea of astral projection.
Yoga Nidra: This practice, sometimes called "yogi sleep," is described as a form of meditation that aims to achieve a higher state of consciousness and spiritual awareness, which can be seen as a form of astral projection. </h3>
<h1 style= "background-color: Gray"> 2)CHRISTIANITY
<h3> Some interpret this vision as a form of astral projection where Jacob's spirit connects with celestial realms.
Paul's vision (2 Corinthians 12): The Apostle Paul describes being "caught up to the third heaven," which some consider to be an out-of-body experience.
Condemnation of sorcery: The Bible also explicitly warns against practices like sorcery, which is often associated with voluntary out-of-body experiences. 
<h1 style="background-color:Pink"> 3) EGYPTIAN-GREEK SCRIPTURES 
<h3> Ancient Egyptians believed that the soul had multiple aspects, the study of the concepts ba and ka respectively throw light into this theory:
Ba: The part of the soul that can fly outside the body in the form of a bird with a human head. It could travel to the afterlife and interact with the living, but it had to be able to return to the body.
Ka: The life force or vital essence of a person, which required nourishment from offerings to remain connected to the physical body and tomb.</h3>
<h2> IN CONCLUSION, THERE WOULD BE LESS NUMBER OF ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ONLY IF YOU NURTURE YOUR INNER SUBCONSCIOUS WITH CARE, POSITIVITY AND REFLECT UPON THEM. </h2>

	<th> 1) A basic human nature which many people aren't aware of: is creating fake scenarios which wouldn't even happen. It can be some kind of escape from reality but the consequences you face can be opposite to the blessing in disguise. A study reveals that half of the youth is slipped into this illusion and they tend to stay in their respective comfort zones for a very long time.</th>.
	<th>1) NO WORK OR JUST FREE TIME TURNING OUT INTO AN UNPRODUCTIVE ONE. <hr> 2) AN OBSESSION PERSUADING YOU TO CREATE FAKE SCENARIOS </th>
	<th> 1) BECOMES AN ADDICTION AND YOU CANNOT SPEND A DAY WITHOUT IMAGINING SUCH FAKE SCENARIOS ABOUT/WITH SOMETHING OR SOMEONE <hr> 2) IT IS ACTUALLY A MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH CAN FEEL SOMETHING PRECIOUS IN THE BEGINNING BUT LATER THE SAME THING CAN PUT YOU INTO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES LIKE ANXIETY OR CAN EVEN LEAD YOU TO SELF-DOUBTNESS OR CRITICISM.</th>

		<tr> 
			<th> 1)Maifestation is a common practise done by most of them in order to achieve the desired goals; it is a spiritual practise which involves many things like affirmations,faith, belief and the enorous working of the inner subconscious(manifestation can be enormous but astrology is always placed abover manifestation because the cosmic mind has the sole authority and miraculous power to shape your future or to break it mercilessly as it depends on the deeds of your previous birth (KARMA).</th>

		<h1> In conclusion, it depends upon your mindset and the action you take- manifesting or maladaptive daydreaming instead of actually working on it </h1>
		<hr> 
		<h1 style="background-color:Yellow";> MIRACULOUS WORKING OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND </h1>
		<h3 style="background-color:Pink";> Ever wondered? other man becoming rich, successful, healthy and energetic whereas the other one becoming the most unsuccessful, unwealthy, weak and lazy. This type of contrast not only lies within the person's habits or mindset but also his subconscious mind. The working of your subconscious mind is so miraculous that it can have the power either to break your life or shape it into a better one. </h3>
        <hr>
		<h1> HOW DOES SUBCONSCIOUS MIND ACTUALLY WORK? </h1>
		<h3 style="background-color:Pink";> You would be amazed to know the working of your subconscious mind. The mind is divided into two more parts- your conscious mind and your subconscious mind. By definition- you already know the meaning of your conscious mind where in you perform, perceive and analyze things with all your brief senses and nervous system. Then what does your subconsious mind do? It perceives things with all your heart and soul- moreover your deepest instincts on how you analyze things, it is something spiritual and powerful which the cosmic mind has gifted and blessed an individual with- subconsious mind. Thus, it is really essential for an individual to nurture his subconscious mind with all the care and an efficient training. </h3>

			<tr> 
				<th> FEW CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND </th>
			</tr>
			<tr> 
				<td> 1)IT DOES NOT ARGUE WITH YOU </td>
			</tr>
			<tr> 
				<td> 2)ACTS AS IF IT IS SUBMISSIVE BUT IN REALITY IT ISN'T AND HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY POWER </td>
			</tr>
			<tr> 
				<td> 3)IT JUST ACCEPTS THE INPUT YOU GIVE IN (DOESN'T MATTER IF THE INPUT IS RIGHT OR WRONG) </td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<h3 style="background-color:Pink";> From the above 3 characteristics, we come to a conclusion that subconscious mind needs to be nurtured with positive messages as input or the consequences would be worse than one could ever imagine and this is the reason why many of them tend to fail despite working really hard for something. You do work hard but you fill your brain with all adverse possibilities which absolutely do not make any sense at all- this habit should be avoided </h3>
